## General Information

As a continuation of previous projects, MineHati Realm Wars focuses on Mobita's story who has now made a portal to Aether Realm. But to his surprise, he has been tricked. Doraemonangis literally cried because of that, and to cope with that, he implemented Aether Realm to Tambang-Kerajinan. To put it simply, MineHati Realm Wars mimics Hearthstone and Yugioh game mechanics. Player can draw cards, summon characters, cast spells, attack with their cards, and win the game when the opponent health goes to zero.
